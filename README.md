# Overview
The idea behind my project is to create a web app using Streamlit that can help generate AI/ML use cases based on the industry and trends you provide. It also helps find datasets related to those use cases from platforms like HuggingFace and Kaggle. Here’s how the system works:

### 1. User Interface (UI):
This is where the user interacts with the app. The user types in:
The industry they’re interested in (e.g., Healthcare, Automotive, etc.).
The trends or focus areas in that industry (e.g., Supply Chain Optimization, Customer Experience, etc.).

### 2. Generating AI/ML Use Cases:
Once the user enters the industry and trends, the app asks an AI model (called UseCaseAgent) to generate 3 AI/ML use cases. These use cases are examples of how AI can improve the industry or trends they’ve selected. For example, if someone selects "Healthcare" and "Patient Care," the app might generate use cases like "Predicting patient outcomes" or "AI-powered diagnosis tools."

### 3. Fetching Datasets:
Once the use cases are generated, the app looks for datasets related to those use cases.It searches for datasets from:
HuggingFace 
Kaggle
The app fetches datasets related to the keywords in the use cases and shows them to the user.
